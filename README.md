# poker-profit-regression

### üìä Project Overview  
This project implements a **quadratic regression model** using the **scikit-learn** package to predict net profit in poker tournaments. The model is based on several predictors, including:
- Game type
- Buy-In
- Total entries
- Entries per individual
- Buy-In with rebuys

Despite adding multiple predictors and tuning the model with **Ridge regression**, the results showed poor performance:
- Both training and testing **RMSEs** remained high
- **R¬≤** values were close to zero

These results suggest that the relationship between the predictors and net profit may not be easily captured by linear models. Additionally, non-linear interactions between the variables did not provide significant improvements.

### üîç Key Findings  
- **Buy-In** and **rebuys** were identified as the most influential factors on profitability.
  - **Rebuys** positively impacted profit.
  - **Higher Buy-In** generally led to lower net earnings.
- Despite these insights, the model showed no substantial improvement, indicating that the chosen predictors may not have a meaningful or strong influence on profitability in this dataset.
